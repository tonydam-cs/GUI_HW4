In this assignment, bootstrap was used to create a more user friendly interface
when they navigating through. The site that was enhanced was our own custom,
personal site that we made for HW2. In this version, it is more mobile friendly
than user friendly. This mobile version features a floating top bar header 
which follows the user if they want to navigate to pages or even be brought
directly down to the links. Text has been resized and centered on the page for
easier viewing. Icons/ images/ image tables have been adjusted to remain the
same size regardless of resolution in which they are viewing the site.
However, this site may seem very big on desktop and fits more when viewed on
a mobile device.
